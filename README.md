This is the first project of TOP. I love the new challenge and I want this to be the solid basis of my path.
This project is about building a new repo, learning how to set up the structure of a new website, add pages and put text, link and images in it.
I would like to be able to change it with CSS in the near future.
At the end of this initial phase of this project I will able to: create a repo on github, copy it in local, access to it through my terminal, create webpages and link them, adding content to the new webpages, as well images and link, display it online.
